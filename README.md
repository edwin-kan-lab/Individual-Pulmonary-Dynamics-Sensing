This repository contains code for the paper titled 'Continuous Sensing of Left and Right Lung Volumes Using Near-Field Radio-Frequency Sensors'

## Abstract
**Objective:** We used near-field radio-frequency (NFRF) sensors on mechanically ventilated porcine models for continuous acquisition of pulmonary dynamics for each lung independently under various cardiopulmonary interventions.
**Methods:** NFRF sensors, previously shown to detect internal tissue motion, were deployed laterally across the pig chest to measure tidal volume during a stepped intervention. A reference spirometer was used for validation. We used bronchial blockers to isolate each lung, allowing us to demonstrate the novel capability of individually monitoring lung volumes. 
**Results:** We demonstrated lung volume measurements with an average error of 9.2% between NFRF and reference spirometry. We also showed individual lung dynamics during one-lung obstruction.
**Conclusion:** NFRF sensors provide a novel wearable method for continuous monitoring of individual lung dynamics. 
**Significance:** NFRF sensing can be employed for real-time continuous lung monitoring, aiding the management of respiratory distress during
acute and chronic conditions.
