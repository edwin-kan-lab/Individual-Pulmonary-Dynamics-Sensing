  abstract = {Near-field radio-frequency(RF) sensing can realize wearable touchless vital-sign sensors with touchless and flexible deployment. By placing a transmitter (Tx) antenna in the near-field region of dielectric boundary motion, both the magnitude and phase of the Tx signal will be modulated and be recorded as a complex signal at the receiver (Rx). Direct-path interference (DPI) from Tx to Rx without motion modulation often dominates and can vary due to different environmental factors and initial transceiver conditions, which can lead to inconsistent waveform morphology of the magnitude and phase at Rx, sometimes even yielding low signal quality or phase reversal. Here we proposed a complex vector injection (CVI) method, which adds a constant complex phasor to the Rx quadrature signal to regularize the waveform morphology selectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVI algorithm, we designed a torso phantom for sensor benchmarking. By using different objective functions to select the optimal injection vector, we can enhance different features in the real-number waveform. Furthermore, we applied the algorithm in the study of 21 human subjects for heartbeat monitoring, and showed that we could effectively enhance the signal quality and regularize the waveform morphology which is critical for time-domain feature recognition in physiological and pathological studies.},

  abstract = {Systolic and diastolic blood pressure estimation using arm-cuff monitors is one of the most common cardiovascular evaluation criteria in healthcare today, however these measures lack critical heartbeat and pressure dynamics. Pulse-transit time can be used as an alternative for arm-cuff monitors, but gives only one parameter for two pressure quantities. Ultrasound, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging can retrieve geometrical features of the heart, but cannot directly estimate vascular pressures. Here we show a novel radio-frequency heartbeat sensor based on multi-point near-field observation. By comparing to synchronized electrocardiogram and auscultation, the multi-point sensor can assess motion and pressure in different parts of the heart following the Wiggers diagram. By applying the Hilbert-Huang frequency-time transform, the central blood pressure can be derived from the vascular vibration characteristics as continuous transients, including during the pulmonary cycle which is previously inaccessible from branchial measurements. Our scheme can be further extended to a full multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channel arrangement, producing rich content for diagnostic and biometric applications. We employ dynamic time warping analyses to illustrate the sensor's wealth of diversified information across different channels and persons. This new multi-point sensor, which can be worn conveniently over clothing, enables unprecedented monitoring capabilities of detailed central blood pressure transients and heartbeat dynamics under the given measurement instructions for at-home and clinical cardiovascular diagnostics.},

Current approaches are limited in accuracy, convenience and sensing capabilities. Some methods such as electrocardiogram (ECG) is difficult for long-term applications due to the requirement of direct skin contact, which is uncomfortable to wearers, restricts body motion and disrupts circadian rhythms. Meanwhile accurate measurement of the inter-heartbeat timing features is important for wellness monitoring and human emotion studies. In this paper, we introduce a new method to modulate the external and internal mechanical motion of the wearer body directly onto multiplexed radio frequency (RF) signals by near- field coherent sensing (NCS). To minimize the deployment and maintenance cost of NCS vital-sign monitoring, passive RF identification (RFID) tags can be integrated into garments at the chest and wrist areas. The unique ID of each tag helps discriminate its signal against interferences from ambient interferences and other tags. NCS utilizes both amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field to couple the motion, which significantly increases the signal quality in comparison to methods based solely on signal strength. The tag backscattering signal is then processed with spectral equalization to amplify the high frequency components to recover not only the waveform details originally submerged in the low-frequency components but also the sharp peaks for precise heartbeat intervals with improved peak detection certainty. The derived heartbeat interval shows improved stability in comparison with synchronous ECG.},

Static biometric methods, such as fingerprint and facial recognition are widely accepted, yet generally vulnerable to targeted presentation attacks. Current development has expanded to dynamic biometrics, such as gait and electrocardiogram, that enable continuous authentication and are significantly more resistant to presentation attacks. However, dynamic biometrics often involve cumbersome acquisition which restricts their widespread use. Here, we introduce Heart ID, a novel dynamic biometric system that uses near-field coherent sensing (NCS) with a multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) radio-frequency (RF) antenna setup to non-invasively acquire detailed recordings of internal cardiac dielectric boundary motion over clothing. NCS couples localized energy to the heart to derive interpersonal structural differences, while MIMO significantly increases the biometric entropy compared to single-point observation. We performed a human study of 20 subjects as well as 2 longitudinal evaluations, and employed an unsupervised feature extraction method to explore the ID performance of this new biometric. We found an ensemble classification approach using features derived from unsupervised learning can achieve accuracy exceeding 99\% at a 40-second epoch.},

This paper illustrates such monitoring using wearable near-field radio-frequency sensors to analyze ventricle and valve transients, which can be used as indicators of myriad cardiac disorders. We applied a novel vector injection signal processing method to improve timing consistency in ventricular contraction, ventricular relaxation, and valve opening extraction. The median relative timing error in valve opening detection was 14.7ms and 37.8ms for semilunar and atrioventricular valves, respectively, as benchmarked by the S1 and S2 heart sounds from a synchronous phonocardiogram. Clinical Relevance--- No wearable sensor currently exists to conveniently and reliably evaluate ventricular and valvular dynamics, specifically valvular opening. Beyond extraction of the heart rate and its variation, the method in this paper has the potential to enable non-invasive measurements of detailed cardiac cycle timing features including valve openings, isovolumetric contraction/relaxation times, and ejection periods, improving the monitoring of patient health away from clinical healthcare centers.},

Here we show that the external and internal mechanical motion of a person can be directly modulated onto multiplexed radiofrequency signals integrated with unique digital identification using near-field coherent sensing. The approach, which does not require direct skin contact, offers two possible implementations: passive and active radiofrequency identification tags. To minimize deployment and maintenance cost, passive tags can be integrated into garments at the chest and wrist areas, where the two multiplexed far-field backscattering waveforms are collected at the reader to retrieve the heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and breath effort. To maximize reading range and immunity to~multipath interference caused by indoor occupant motion, active tags could~be placed in the front pocket and in the wrist cuff to measure the antenna reflection due to near-field coherent sensing and then the vital signals~sampled and transmitted entirely in digital format.

When a moving or shape-changing dielectric is placed in the near-field region of a pair of transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) antennas, the Tx signal propagating to the dielectric will be backscattered and modulated by the motion as a time-varying complex phasor signal at the Rx. In this article, we proposed a semianalytical model based on the electromagnetic field perturbation of the electric dipole (ED) mode of a dielectric sphere. Our proposed model analyzed how the changes in object shape, antenna pair position, and carrier frequency affect the backscattered field. To validate our proposed field model, we designed a torso phantom and performed experiments with an antenna pair at eight different front positions as well as four different sub-1-GHz carrier frequencies. Our model-generated signals had an average of 0.98 cross-correlations with the experimental recording from the six central positions and four frequencies. Furthermore, we added scaling factors to represent the antenna performance for magnitude and phase matching. After performing a least-squares fitting, our scaling model achieved similar fitting errors as the ground-truth measurement variations with average adjusted R -squared scores of 0.86 and 0.89 for different sensing positions and carrier frequencies.},

Various voluntary exercises of normal, deep, fast, held and blocked breathing were measured under different postures of supine, recumbent and sitting by the carrier frequency range between 900MHz and 2.4GHz.

Dyspnea is usually self-reported by patients using, for example, the Borg scale from 0 -- 10, which is however subjective and problematic for those who refuse to cooperate or cannot communicate. The objective of this paper was to develop a learning-based model that can evaluate the correlation between the self-report Borg score and the respiratory metrics for dyspnea induced by exertion and increased airway resistance. Methods: A non-invasive wearable radio-frequency sensor by near-field coherent sensing was employed to retrieve continuous respiratory data with user comfort and convenience. Self-report dyspnea scores and respiratory features were collected on 32 healthy participants going through various physical and breathing exercises. A machine learning model based on the decision tree and random forest then produced an objective dyspnea score. Results: For unseen data as well as unseen participants, the objective dyspnea score can be in reasonable agreement with the self-report score, and the importance factor of each respiratory metrics can be assessed. Conclusion: An objective dyspnea score can potentially complement or substitute the self-report for physiologically induced dyspnea. Significance: The method can potentially formulate a baseline for clinical dyspnea assessment and help caregivers track dyspnea continuously, especially for patients who cannot report themselves.},

Two prototype sensors were placed on the participants, one close to the heart and the other below the xiphoid process to couple to the motion from heart, lungs and diaphragm, by the near-field coherent sensing principle. We can achieve a satisfactory correlation of our sensor with the reference devices for the three vital signs: heart rate (r\,=\,0.95), respiratory rate (r\,=\,0.93) and respiratory volume (r\,=\,0.84). We also detected voluntary breath-hold periods with an accuracy of 96\%. Further, the participants performed a breathing exercise by contracting abdomen inwards while holding breath, leading to paradoxical outward thorax motion under the isovolumetric condition, which was detected with an accuracy of 83\%.},

  abstract = {Background: No methods are superior when setting positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in acute lung injury (ALI). In ALI, the vertical distance (hysteresis) between the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of a static pressure--volume (PV) loop mainly indicates lung recruitment. We hypothesized that PEEP set at the pressure where hysteresis is 90\% of its maximum (90\%MH) would give similar oxygenation, but less cardiovascular depression than PEEP set at the pressure at lower inflection point (LIP) on the inspiratory limb or at the point of maximal curvature (PMC) on the expiratory limb in ALI. Methods: In 12 mechanically ventilated pigs, ALI was induced in a randomized fashion by lung lavage, lung lavage plus injurious ventilation, or by oleic acid. From a static PV loop obtained by an interrupted low-flow method, the pressures at LIP [25 (25, 25) cmH2O, mean and 25, 75 percentiles], at PMC [24 (20, 24) cmH2O], and at 90\% MH [19 (18, 19) cmH2O] were determined and used for the PEEP-settings. We measured lung inflation (by computed tomography), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), airway pressures, compliance of the respiratory system (Crs), blood gases, cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. Results: There were no differences between the PEEP settings in EELV or oxygenation, but the 90\%MH setting gave lower end-inspiratory pause pressure (P{$<$}0.025), higher Crs (P{$<$}0.025), less hyper-aeration (P{$<$}0.025) and better maintained hemodynamics. Conclusion: In this porcine lung injury model, PEEP set at 90\% MH gave better lung mechanics and hemodynamics, than PEEP set at PMC or LIP.},

  abstract = {The injurious effects of alveolar overdistention are well accepted, and there is little debate regarding the importance of pressure and volume limitation during mechanical ventilation. The role of recruitment maneuvers is more controversial. Alveolar recruitment is desirable if it can be achieved, but the potential for recruitment is variable among patients with ARDS. A stepwise recruitment maneuver, similar to an incremental PEEP titration, is favored over sustained inflation recruitment maneuvers. Many approaches to PEEP titration have been proposed, and the best method to choose the most appropriate level for an individual patient is unclear. A PEEP level should be selected that balances alveolar recruitment against overdistention. The easiest approach to select PEEP might be according to the severity of the disease: 5--10 cm H2O PEEP in mild ARDS, 10--15 cm H2O PEEP in moderate ARDS, and 15--20 cm H2O PEEP in severe ARDS. Recruitment maneuvers and PEEP should be used within the context of lung protection and not just as a means of improving oxygenation.},

  abstract = {Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been used during mechanical ventilation since the first description of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the subsequent decades, many different strategies for optimally titrating PEEP have been proposed. Higher PEEP can improve arterial oxygenation, reduce tidal lung stress and strain, and promote more homogenous ventilation by preventing alveolar collapse at end expiration. However, PEEP may also cause circulatory depression and contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury through alveolar overdistention. The overall effect of PEEP is primarily related to the balance between the number of alveoli that are recruited to participate in ventilation and the amount of lung that is overdistended when PEEP is applied. Techniques to assess lung recruitment from PEEP may help to direct safer and more effective PEEP titration. Some PEEP titration strategies attempt to weigh beneficial effects on arterial oxygenation and on prevention of cyclic alveolar collapse with the harmful potential of overdistention. One method for PEEP titration is a PEEP/FiO2 table that prioritizes support for arterial oxygenation. Other methods set PEEP based on mechanical parameters, such as the plateau pressure, respiratory system compliance, or transpulmonary pressure. No single method of PEEP titration has been shown to improve clinical outcomes compared with other approaches of setting PEEP. Future trials should focus on identifying individuals who respond to higher PEEP with recruitment and on clinically important outcomes (e.g., mortality).},

Understanding the role of the main factors affecting oxygen availability, such as the gradient of pressure of oxygen during normal conditions, and during hypoxia is an important point. Several factors such as anaesthesia, hypoxia, and stress affect the regulation of the atmospheric, alveolar, arterial, capillary and tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PO2). Our objective is to offer to the reader a summarized and practical appraisal of the mechanisms related to the oxygen's supply within the human body, including a facilitated description of the gradient of pressure from the atmosphere to the cells.

We compared the effects of end-expiratory lung volume (EELV)-guided versus PaO2-guided PEEP determination on respiratory mechanics and oxygenation during the first 48 hours in moderate to severe ARDS. Twenty-two patients with moderate to severe ARDS admitted to an academic medical ICU were assigned to PaO2-guided (n = 11) or to EELV-guided PEEP determination (n = 11) group. First, an incremental PEEP trial was performed by increasing PEEP by 3 cmH2O steps from 8 to 20 cmH2O and in each step EELV and lung mechanics were measured in both groups. Then, oxygenation and respiratory mechanics were measured under the determined PEEP at 4, 12, 24, and 48th hours. After the incremental PEEP trial, over the 48 hours of the study period, in the EELV-guided group PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 increased (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02; respectively), whereas they did not change in PaO2-guided group (p = 0.09 and p = 0.27; respectively). In all patients, the median value of EELV change ({$\Delta$}EELV) during incremental PEEP trial was 25\%. In patients with {$\Delta$}EELV {$>$} 25\% (n = 11) PaO2, PaO2/FiO2 and Cs increased over time in 48 hours (p = 0.03, p {$<$} 0.01, and p = 0.04; respectively), whereas they did not change in those with {$\Delta$}EELV {$\leq$} 25\% (n = 11) (p = 0.73, p = 0.51, and p = 0.73; respectively). Compared to PaO2-guided PEEP determination, EELV-guided PEEP determination resulted in greater improvement in oxygenation over time. Patients who had {$>$} 25\% improvement in EELV during a PEEP trial had greater improvement in oxygenation and compliance over 48 hours. Supplemental data for this article is available online at},

However, JVP dynamics are not widely utilized in clinical settings, as its observation and sensing remain cumbersome. Noninvasive measures of cardiac behavior, including the JVP, are of growing interest to enable continuous and at-home monitoring of cardiac disorders. In this work, we propose a wearable near-field radio frequency (RF) sensor affixed with a neck collar on the clavicle over the internal jugular vein (IJV) to enable noninvasive JVP sensing. We employed a complex vector injection signal processing method to extract repeatable JVP waveform features in multiple postures. With a 21-subject human study, we demonstrated morphologically consistent JVP sensing with consistent a-, c-, and v-wave feature timings, benchmarked by synchronous electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG). Furthermore, inter-postural experiments demonstrated the capability of the proposed system to quantify morphological changes to the JVP, which are present in many cardiac disorders. The results of this work suggest that the proposed near-field RF sensor is capable of noninvasive JVP monitoring, potentially enabling improved sensing in both clinical and ambulatory environments.},

However, there is no clear conclusion regarding the value of PEEP in elderly patients undergoing lobectomy. Material/Methods Fifty patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic unilateral lobectomy, aged 65 to 78 years, with a body mass index of 18 to 29 kg/m2 and ASA grades I to III, were randomly divided into 2 groups (n=25 each): optimal oxygenation titration group (group O) and optimal compliance titration group (group C). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) were recorded in both groups at different time points. The radial artery blood samples were collected at 3 time points for blood gas analysis, and the void volume/tidal volume ratio was calculated. The peak airway pressure and PEEP values were recorded at 4 min after the completion of one-lung ventilation titration (T2), and the driving pressure was calculated. Results The best PEEP value of titration in the best compliance group was lower than that of the best oxygenation method, the peak was lower, and the dynamic lung compliance was higher; however, this had no effect on MAP and HR. The CVP was lower than optimal oxygenation at T2. Conclusions Dynamic lung compliance-guided PEEP titration improved lung function in elderly patients undergoing lobectomy.},

Recent studies have shown that machine learning algorithms could benefit from good feature representation, explaining why deep learning has achieved breakthrough performance in many tasks. In deep learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the most well-known approaches, since it incorporates feature learning and classification task in a unified network architecture. Although CNN has been successfully applied to image and text domains, it is still a challenge to apply CNN to time series data. This paper proposes a tensor scheme along with a novel deep learning architecture called multivariate convolutional neural network (MVCNN) for multivariate time series classification, in which the proposed architecture considers multivariate and lag-feature characteristics. We evaluate our proposed method with the prognostics and health management (PHM) 2015 challenge data, and compare with several algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other alternatives using the prediction score, which is the evaluation metric used by the PHM Society 2015 data challenge. Besides performance evaluation, we provide detailed analysis about the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Background One-lung ventilation (OLV) is necessary for selected surgical settings and medical conditions. Different methods have been described and used to isolate 1 lung, including the double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and a variety of bronchial blockers (BBs). This selection is often based on the preferences and experiences of the anesthesiologist and surgeon. Complications associated with OLV isolation tubes have been previously described, but complications specifically associated with the Cohen BB (CBB) (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) have not been investigated. The purpose of this retrospective review was to determine the incidence of vocal cord injury, tracheobronchial injury, and hoarseness in adult patients who underwent OLV with the CBB. Methods We reviewed electronic anesthesia records, operative dictation, and inpatient progress notes to collect information about vocal cord injury, bronchial injury, hoarseness, and sore throat for adults who underwent surgical and diagnostic procedures requiring OLV. Secondary endpoints were types of surgical procedures, degree of difficulty with orotracheal intubation, ability of the patient to tolerate extubation in the operating room, and whether the thoracic surgeon deemed the lung separation adequate. P{$<$}0.05 was considered significant. Results Of 130 patients, 113 underwent OLV with a CBB, and 17 patients underwent OLV with a DLT. The thoracic surgeon deemed the lung isolation adequate in all cases. Airway injury occurred in 2 patients with a CBB and none with a DLT (P=0.86). Both airway injuries were attributed to surgical technique. Two cases of postoperative hoarseness occurred in the CBB group (P=0.86). One injury was attributed to vagus nerve transection, and the other injury was diagnosed as vocal cord paralysis of unknown etiology. In 1 case, orotracheal intubation with a DLT was unsuccessful because of intubation difficulty and required conversion to a regular endotracheal tube and CBB for successful lung isolation. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the use of CBB can be successful in a wide variety of thoracic operations, has minimal complications, eliminates the need for tracheal tube exchange when postoperative mechanical ventilation is required, and effectively isolates the lungs of critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Introduction Millions of deaths and co-morbidities have been brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic worldwide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death can result from the condition in some people. The disease's course can range from a moderate upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia. Numerous reports have been made on the occurrence of pneumothorax in COVID-19 ICU patients, particularly in those who are receiving invasive ventilation. This study assesses factors associated with pneumothorax among mechanically ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A case-control study design was employed from August 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022, GC, with a sample size of 281, where cases are 94 and controls are 187. A pre-tested structured quantitative tool was used to collect data on ODK and export it to SPSS version 26 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were presented using text and tables. The association between variables was analyzed with binary logistic regression. A statistical significance was declared at a p-value of 0.05 with a 95\% confidence interval. Assumptions like model fitness and multicollinearity were checked to be satisfied. Results A total of 281 (94 cases and 187 controls) patient charts were carefully reviewed. After adjustment for possible confounders in multivariate analysis, ARDS (AOR = 0.214, 95\% CI (0.088, 0.519), P value =0.001) and invasive ventilation (AOR = 0.311, 95\% CI (0.121, 0.796), P value =0.015) had a significant association with pneumothorax. Conclusion Despite the introduction of preventive breathing methods, pneumothorax is still a frequent and deadly consequence in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. ARDS and invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be significantly associated with the development of pneumothorax. Health facilities should be well equipped with recent medical equipment in intensive care units and with well-trained and organized manpower.},

Through these mechanisms, PEEP improves arterial oxygenation and may reduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Because of the many potential negative effects associated with the use of PEEP, much research has concentrated on determining the optimal PEEP setting. Arterial oxygenation targets and pressure-volume loops have been utilized to set the optimal PEEP for decades. Several other techniques have been suggested, including the use of PEEP tables, compliance, driving pressure (DP), stress index (SI), transpulmonary pressures, imaging, and electrical impedance tomography. Each of these techniques has its own benefits and limitations and there is currently not one technique that is recommended above all others.},

  abstract = {Most clinicians pay attention to tidal volume and airway pressures and their curves during mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, inspiratory--expiratory flow curves also provide a plethora of information, but much less attention is paid to them. Flow curves chronologically show the velocity and direction of inspiration and expiration and are influenced by the respiratory mechanics, the patient's effort, and the mode of ventilation and its settings. When the ventilator setting does not synchronize with the patient's respiratory pattern, the patient can easily have worsening breathing effort, patient--ventilator asynchrony, which can lead to prolonged ventilator support or lung injury. The information provided by the flow curves during mechanical ventilation, such as respiratory mechanics, the patient's effort, and patient--ventilator interactions, are very helpful when adjusting the ventilator setting. If clinicians can monitor and assess the flow curves information appropriately, it can be a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool at the bedside. There may be association between inspiratory effort and flow, and this may further guide us, especially in the weaning process and when patients are not synchronizing with the ventilator. In this review, we try to gather information about ``flow'' that is scattered around in the literature and textbooks in one place. We will summarize the different flow waveforms utilized in commonly used ventilator modes with their advantages and disadvantages, information gained by the flow curves (i.e., flow-time, flow-volume, and flow-pressure), how to detect and manage asynchronies, and some ideas for future uses. Flow waveforms shapes and patterns are very beneficial for the management of patients undergoing mechanical ventilatory support. Attention to those waveforms can potentially improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should be familiar with this information and how to act upon them.},

  abstract = {The characterization of breathing dynamics provides researchers and clinicians the ability to differentiate respiratory compensation, impairment, disease progression, ventilator assistance, and the onset of respiratory failure. However, within many sub-fields of respiratory physiology, we still have challenges identifying changes within the breathing dynamics and critical respiratory states. We discuss one fundamental modeling of breathing and how modeling imprecise assumptions decades ago regarding breathing are still propagating into our quantitative analysis today, limiting our characterization and modeling of breathing. The assumption that breathing is a continuous sinusoidal wave that can consist of a single frequency which is composed of a stationary time-invariant process has limited our expanded discussion of breathing dynamics, modeling, functional testings, and metrics. Therefore, we address major misnomers regarding breathing dynamics, specifically rate, rhythm, frequency, and period. We demonstrate how these misnomers impact the characterization and modeling through the force equations that are linked to the Work of Breathing (WoB) and our interpretation of breathing dynamics through the fundamental models and create possible erroneous evaluations of work of breathing. This discussion and simplified non-periodic WoB models ultimately sets the foundation for improved quantitative approaches needed to further our understanding of breathing dynamics, compensation, and adaptation.},

  abstract = {During one-lung ventilation (OLV), titrating the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to target a low driving pressure (∆P) could reduce postoperative pulmonary complications. However, it is unclear how to conduct PEEP titration: by stepwise increase starting from zero PEEP (PEEPINCREMENTAL) or by stepwise decrease after a lung recruiting manoeuvre (PEEPDECREMENTAL). In this randomized trial, we compared the physiological effects of these two PEEP titration strategies on respiratory mechanics, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and gas exchange. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in OLV were randomly assigned to a PEEPINCREMENTAL or PEEPDECREMENTAL strategy to match the lowest ∆P. In the PEEPINCREMENTAL group, PEEP was stepwise titrated from ZEEP up to 16 cm H2O, whereas in the PEEPDECREMENTAL group PEEP was decrementally titrated, starting from 16 cm H2O, immediately after a lung recruiting manoeuvre. Respiratory mechanics, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and blood gas analyses were recorded at baseline, after PEEP titration and at the end of surgery. Sixty patients were included in the study. After PEEP titration, shunt decreased similarly in both groups, from 50 [39--55]\% to 35 [28--42]\% in the PEEPINCREMENTAL and from 45 [37--58]\% to 33 [25--45]\% in the PEEPDECREMENTAL group (both p {$<$} 0.001 vs baseline). The resulting ∆P, however, was lower in the PEEPDECREMENTAL than in the PEEPINCREMENTAL group (8 [7--11] vs 10 [9--11] cm H2O; p = 0.03). In the PEEPDECREMENTAL group the PaO2/ FIO2 ratio increased significantly after intervention (from 140 [99--176] to 186 [152--243], p {$<$} 0.001). Both the PEEPINCREMENTAL and the PEEPDECREMENTAL strategies were able to decrease intraoperative shunt, but only PEEPDECREMENTAL improved oxygenation and lowered intraoperative {$\Delta$}P.},

However, the method by which the optimal PEEP is determined and titrated varies widely. Methods for determining optimal PEEP have been assessed using a variety of different study designs and patient populations. We will conduct a scoping review to systematically identify all methods for determining optimal PEEP, and to identify the patient populations, outcomes measured and study designs used for each method. The goal will be to identify gaps in the optimal PEEP literature and identify areas where there may be an opportunity to further systematically synthesise and meta-analyse existing literature. Methods and analysis Using scoping review methodology, we will generate a comprehensive search strategy based on inclusion and exclusion criteria generated using the population, concept, context framework. Five different databases will be searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Scopus). Three investigators will independently screen titles and abstracts, and two investigators will independently complete full-text review and data extraction. Included citations will be categorised in terms of PEEP method, study design, patient population and outcomes measured. The methods for PEEP titration will be described in detail, including strengths and limitations. Ethics and dissemination Given this is a synthesis of existing literature, ethics approval is not required. The results will be disseminated to stakeholders via presentation at local, regional and national levels, as well as publication in a high-impact critical care journal. There is also the potential to impact local clinical care protocols and inform broader clinical practice guidelines undertaken by societies.},

Previous studies assessed the global current-day prevalence of COPD, but to better facilitate resource planning and intervention development, long-term projections are needed.To assess the global burden of COPD through 2050, considering COPD risk factors.In this modeling study, historical data on COPD prevalence was extracted from a recent meta-analysis on 2019 global COPD prevalence, and 2010 to 2018 historical prevalence was estimated using random-effects meta-analytical models. COPD risk factor data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease database.To project global COPD prevalence to 2050, generalized additive models were developed, including smoking prevalence, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and development indices as predictors, and stratified by age, sex, and World Bank region.The models estimated that the number of COPD cases globally among those aged 25 years and older will increase by 23\% from 2020 to 2050, approaching 600 million patients with COPD globally by 2050. Growth in the burden of COPD was projected to be the largest among women and in low- and middle-income regions. The number of female cases was projected to increase by 47.1\% (vs a 9.4\% increase for males), and the number of cases in low- and middle-income regions was expected to be more than double that of high-income regions by 2050.In this modeling study of future COPD burden, projections indicated that COPD would continue to affect hundreds of millions of people globally, with disproportionate growth among females and in low-middle income regions through 2050. Further research, prevention, and advocacy are needed to address these issues so that adequate preparation and resource allocation can take place.},

  abstract = {Lung isolation describes either anatomic or physiologic separation of~1 lung from the other using an advanced airway device, typically a bronchial blocker or double-lumen endotracheal tube. Anatomical lung isolation separates a diseased lung and prevents~contamination of~the healthy lung. For example, in the case of whole lung lavage, anatomical lung isolation is used to avoid spillage of blood or pus from the diseased to the healthy lung. Physiological lung separation ventilates each lung as an independent unit and may be indicated when unilateral lung pathology requires differential ventilatory parameters for each lung. One-lung ventilation is the ability to ventilate~1 lung while allowing the other to collapse to facilitate surgical exposure or manage disease states. The deflation of~1 lung can establish an immobile surgical field and create space within the thorax, allowing access to anatomical structures.~ A~clinician with advanced airway training (ie, anesthesiologist or intensivist) should place the~double-lumen endotracheal~or bronchial blocker. Extensive knowledge of pulmonary physiology is essential for managing lung isolation, particularly during periods of 1-lung ventilation, which can be complicated by hypoxia. When used to facilitate surgery, lung isolation requires clear communication between the surgical and anesthesiology teams to prevent and manage complications. In the intensive care setting, nurses and respiratory therapists must be aware of the physiologic consequences of differential or 1-lung ventilation and detect changes in the patient's condition that may indicate a problem with lung isolation.},

  abstract = {Atelectasis is one of the most commonly encountered abnormalities in chest radiology and remains a daily diagnostic challenge. At times atelectasis can be overlooked, particularly when pulmonary opacification is minimal or absent, and at other times it might be interpreted as being some other form of intrathoracic pathology, particularly pneumonia. The direct signs of atelectasis are crowded pulmonary vessels, crowded air bronchograms, and displacement of the interlobar fissures. Indirect signs of atelectasis are pulmonary opacification; elevation of the diaphragm; shift of the trachea, heart, and mediastinum; displacement of the hilus; compensatory hyperexpansion of the surrounding lung; approximation of the ribs; and shifting granulomas. For descriptive purposes, atelectasis can be divided into the following types: segmental, lobar, or whole lung; subsegmental; platelike, linear, or discoid; round; and generalized or diffuse. Resorption atelectasis is caused by resorption of alveolar air distal to obstructing lesions of the airways; adhesive atelectasis stems from surfactant deficiency; passive atelectasis is caused by simple pneumo-thorax, diaphragmatic dysfunction, or hypoventilation; compressive atelectasis is due to tension pneumothorax, space-occupying intrathoracic lesions, or abdominal distention; cicatrization atelectasis stems from pulmonary fibrosis; and gravity-dependent atelectasis is the result of gravity-dependent alterations in alveolar volume. Whenever signs of volume loss are present on a chest radiograph, the radiograph should be interpreted as showing atelectasis. By understanding the various mechanisms leading to atelectasis, and by considering the underlying conditions, the radiologist should be able to develop an appropriate list of the possible causes of atelectasis. The diagnosis of atelectatic pneumonia should be based upon the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia coupled with the identification of pathogenic bacteria in sputum, tracheal aspirates, or protected bronchoalveolar lavage or bronchial brush specimens rather than on the radiographic identification of atelectasis alone.},

Methods: The main evidences about the NCDs and CRDs burden and related risk factors, from updated international reports and results of original researches, were collected and described in this review. Results: Most recent evidence is available from the Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2017 reports. There were 3.2 million deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 495,000 deaths due to asthma. COPD was the seventh leading cause of years of life lost (YLLs). Overall, prevalent cases of CRDs were 545 million: about 50\% for COPD and 50\% for asthma. Incident cases of CRDs were 62 million, mostly due to asthma (69\%) and COPD (29\%). COPD accounted for 81.6 million disability-adjusted life years, asthma for 22.8 million. COPD prevalence of 9.1\% has been found in a recent general population sample of North-Eastern Italy, while in Central Italy a 25-year follow-up of a general population sample has shown an increased prevalence of COPD and asthma up to 6.8\% and 7.8\%, respectively. In Central Italy, a COPD incidence of 8\% and an asthma incidence of 3.2\% have been found in adult subjects at an 18-year follow-up. Among the risk factors, a relevant role is played by smoking and high body mass index for asthma, while smoking, particulate matter pollution, ambient ozone pollution, occupational exposure to particulate matter, gases and fumes, as well as second-hand smoke, play an important role for COPD. Forecasting the YLLs by 2040 indicates a rising toll from several NCDs due to population growth and aging, with COPD expected to reach the fourth leading cause. Conclusions: Several recent studies and international reports highlighted the huge global health burden of CRDs and other major NCDs, pointing out the need for implementing international collaborations to fight this epidemic trend.}

Obesity is a complex disease which has reached pandemic dimensions. The worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, mainly due to the adoption of a progressively more sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of less healthy diets. We first report herein updated prevalence rates of overweight and obesity by sex, age, and region first in Europe, per the WHO report, and then worldwide between 1980 and 2019, as we analyze and present herein the data provided by the Global Burden of Disease Study. The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men of any age and the prevalence of both overweight and obesity increases with age and has reached their highest point between the ages of 50 to 65~years showing a slight downward trend afterwards. The age-standardized prevalence of obesity has increased from 4.6\% in 1980 to 14.0\% in 2019. The American and European region have the highest obesity prevalence and the USA and Russia are the countries with the most obese residents. Given dire implications in terms of comorbidities and mortality, these updated epidemiological findings call for coordinated actions from local and regional governments, the scientific community and individual patients alike, as well as the food industry for the obesity pandemic to be controlled and alleviated. We can hopefully learn from the COVID-19 pandemic, where collaborative efforts worldwide, focused intense work at both the local and global level and well-coordinated leadership have demonstrated that humankind is capable of amazing accomplishments by leveraging science and public health, and that we can finally make strides in terms of understanding and combating the obesity pandemic and its dire comorbidities including diabetes, NAFLD, CVD and obesity associated malignancies.},

  abstract = {Climate change is one of the major public health emergencies with already unprecedented impacts on our planet, environment and health. Climate change has already resulted in substantial increases in temperatures globally and more frequent and extreme weather in terms of heatwaves, droughts, dust storms, wildfires, rainstorms and flooding, with prolonged and altered allergen and microbial exposure as well as the introduction of new allergens to certain areas. All these exposures may have a major burden on patients with respiratory conditions, which will pose increasing challenges for respiratory clinicians and other healthcare providers. In addition, complex interactions between these different factors, along with other major environmental risk factors (e.g. air pollution), will exacerbate adverse health effects on the lung. For example, an increase in heat and sunlight in urban areas will lead to increases in ozone exposure among urban populations; effects of very high exposure to smoke and pollution from wildfires will be exacerbated by the accompanying heat and drought; and extreme precipitation events and flooding will increase exposure to humidity and mould indoors. This review aims to bring respiratory healthcare providers up to date with the newest research on the impacts of climate change on respiratory health. Respiratory clinicians and other healthcare providers need to be continually educated about the challenges of this emerging and growing public health problem and be equipped to be the key players in solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change on patients with respiratory conditions., Climate change is a major threat to lung patients due to increasing temperatures, more extreme weather, poorer air quality, and altered allergen and microbial exposure. Respiratory clinicians must be educated to mitigate this burden to their patients. https://bit.ly/43lE32N},

Whereas the current Berlin definition was proposed in 2012 and mainly focused on intubated patients under invasive mechanical ventilation, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a more comprehensive definition of ARDS including patients treated with noninvasive oxygenation strategies, especially high-flow nasal oxygen therapy, and fulfilling all other diagnostic criteria. Early identification of ARDS in patients breathing spontaneously may allow assessment of earlier initiation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. In the same way, accurate identification of the ARDS etiology is obviously of paramount importance for early initiation of adequate treatment. The precise underlying etiological diagnostic (bacterial, viral, fungal, immune, malignant, drug-induced, etc.) as well as the diagnostic approach have been understudied in the literature. To date, no clinical practice guidelines have recommended structured diagnostic work-up in ARDS patients. In addition to lung-protective ventilation with the aim of preventing worsening lung injury, specific treatment of the underlying cause has a central role to improve outcomes. In this review, we discuss early identification of ARDS in non-intubated patients breathing spontaneously and propose a structured diagnosis work-up.},

SUMMARY: It is important to differentiate COPD from other diagnoses when adult patients present with dyspnea. There are several key diagnostic indicators for COPD, including, most notably, a history of smoking and objective lung-function measurements. COPD remains an underdiagnosed disease, chiefly in its milder and more treatable form. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)- defined standards for COPD management consist of 4 components: (1) assess and monitor disease, (2) reduce risk factors, (3) manage stable COPD through education and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means, and (4) manage exacerbations. CONCLUSION: Updated standards for diagnosis and treatment-targeted pharmacologic agents have provided physicians and health care workers with more specific and targeted treatment modalities for early detection and treatment of this progressive disease. Early detection and more accurate diagnosis are key in improving outcomes and altering the progression of the disease.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients can suffer from low blood oxygen concentrations. Peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), as assessed by pulse oximetry, is commonly measured during the day using a spot check, or continuously during one or two nights to estimate nocturnal desaturation. Sampling at this frequency may overlook natural fluctuations in SpO2. Objective: This study used wearable finger pulse oximeters to continuously measure SpO2 during daily home routines of COPD patients and assess natural SpO2 fluctuations. Methods: A total of 20 COPD patients wore a WristOx2 pulse oximeter for 1 week to collect continuous SpO2 measurements. A SenseWear Armband simultaneously collected actigraphy measurements to provide contextual information. SpO2 time series were preprocessed and data quality was assessed afterward. Mean SpO2, SpO2 SD, and cumulative time spent with SpO2 below 90\% (CT90) were calculated for every (1) day, (2) day in rest, and (3) night to assess SpO2 fluctuations. Results: A high percentage of valid SpO2 data (daytime: 93.27\%; nocturnal: 99.31\%) could be obtained during a 7-day monitoring period, except during moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (67.86\%). Mean nocturnal SpO2 (89.9\%, SD 3.4) was lower than mean daytime SpO2 in rest (92.1\%, SD 2.9; P{$<$}.001). On average, SpO2 in rest ranged over 10.8\% (SD 4.4) within one day. Highly varying CT90 values between different nights led to 50\% (10/20) of the included patients changing categories between desaturator and nondesaturator over the course of 1 week. Conclusions: Continuous SpO2 measurements with wearable finger pulse oximeters identified significant SpO2 fluctuations between and within multiple days and nights of patients with COPD. Continuous SpO2 measurements during daily home routines of patients with COPD generally had high amounts of valid data, except for motion artifacts during MVPA. The identified fluctuations can have implications for telemonitoring applications that are based on daily SpO2 spot checks. CT90 values can vary greatly from night to night in patients with a nocturnal mean SpO2 around 90\%, indicating that these patients cannot be consistently categorized as desaturators or nondesaturators. We recommend using wearable sensors for continuous SpO2 measurements over longer time periods to determine the clinical relevance of the identified SpO2 fluctuations.},

Despite the frequent use of SpO2 measurements in telemonitoring of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), no profound overview is available about these measurements. Areas covered: A systematic search identified 71 articles that performed SpO2 measurements in COPD telemonitoring. The results indicate that long-term follow-up of COPD patients using daily SpO2 spot checks is practically feasible. Very few studies specified protocols for performing these measurements. In many studies, deviating SpO2 values were used to raise alerts that led to immediate action from healthcare professionals. However, little information was available about the exact implementation and performance of these alerts. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the real value of SpO2 measurements. Future research could optimize performance of alerts using individualized, time-dependent thresholds or predictive algorithms to account for individual differences and SpO2 baseline changes. Additionally, the value of performing continuous measurements should be examined. Expert commentary: Standardization of the measurements, data science techniques and advancing technology can still boost performance of telemonitoring applications. All these opportunities should be thoroughly explored to assess the real value of SpO2 in COPD telemonitoring.},

We also investigated innovative technologies such as the monitoring of thorax micromovements based on the principles of seismocardiography, ballistocardiography, remote camera recordings, deployment of integrated optical fibers, or extraction of respiration from cardiovascular variables. Our review is extended to include acoustic methods and breath and blood gas analysis, providing a comprehensive overview of different approaches to respiratory monitoring. The topic of monitoring respiration with wearable and remote electronics is currently the center of attention of researchers, which is also reflected by the growing number of publications. In our manuscript, we offer an overview of the most interesting ones.},

Physiol. 83(5): 1762--1767, 1997.---Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) uses electrical measurements at electrodes placed around the thorax to image changes in the conductivity distribution within the thorax. This technique is well suited to studying pulmonary function because the movement of air, blood, and extravascular fluid induces significant conductivity changes within the thorax. We conducted three experimental protocols in a total of 19 dogs to assess the accuracy with which EIT can quantify changes in the volumes of both gas and fluid in the lungs. In the first protocol, lung volume increments from 50 to 1,000 ml were applied with a large syringe. EIT measured these volume changes with an average error of 27 {\textpm} 6 ml. In the second protocol, EIT measurements were made at end expiration and end inspiration during regular ventilation with tidal volume ranging from 100 to 1,000 ml. The average error in the EIT estimates of tidal volume was 90 {\textpm} 43 ml. In the third protocol, lung liquid volume was measured by instilling 5\% albumin solution into a lung lobe in increments ranging from 10 to 100 ml. EIT measured these volume changes with an average error of 10 {\textpm} 10 ml and was also able to detect into which lobe the fluid had been instilled. These results indicate that EIT can noninvasively measure changes in the volumes of both gas and fluid in the lungs with clinically useful accuracy.},

Our disposable respiration sensor with a Band-Aid{\copyright} like formfactor can measure both respiration rate and volume by simply measuring the local strain of the ribcage and abdomen during breathing. We demonstrate that both metrics are highly correlated to measurements from a medical grade continuous spirometer on participants at rest. Additionally, we also show that the system is capable of detecting respiration under various ambulatory conditions. Because these low-powered piezo-resistive sensors can be integrated with wireless Bluetooth units, they can be useful in monitoring patients with chronic respiratory diseases in everyday settings.},

Therefore, future strategies to improve COPD management and outcomes are needed for the betterment of patient care. Wearable technology interventions offer considerable promise in improving outcomes, but prior reviews fall short of assessing their role in the COPD population. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched ovid-MEDLINE, ovid-EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and IEEE databases from inception to April 2023 to identify studies investigating wearable technology interventions in an adult COPD population with prespecified outcomes of interest including physical activity promotion, increasing exercise capacity, exacerbation detection, and quality-of-life. We identified 7396 studies, of which 37 were included in our review. Meta-analysis showed wearable technology interventions significantly increased: the mean daily step count (mean difference (MD) 850 (494--1205) steps/day) and the six-minute walk distance (MD 5.81\,m (1.02--10.61\,m). However, the impact was short-lived. Furthermore, wearable technology coupled with another facet (such as health coaching or pulmonary rehabilitation) had a greater impact that wearable technology alone. Wearable technology had little impact on quality-of-life measures and had mixed results for exacerbation avoidance and prediction. It is clear that wearable technology interventions may have the potential to form a core part of future COPD management plans, but further work is required to translate this into meaningful clinical benefit.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The value of monitoring physiological parameters to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations is controversial. A few studies have suggested benefit from domiciliary monitoring of vital signs, and/or lung function but there is no existing systematic review. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of monitoring physiological parameters to predict COPD exacerbation. Methods: An electronic systematic search compliant with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was conducted. The search was updated to April 6, 2016. Five databases were examined: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or MEDLARS Online (Medline), Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane clinical trials database. Results: Sixteen articles met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Fifteen of these articules reported positive results in predicting COPD exacerbation via monitoring of physiological parameters. Nine studies showed a reduction in peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2\%) prior to exacerbation onset. Three studies for peak flow, and two studies for respiratory rate reported a significant variation prior to or at exacerbation onset. A particular challenge is accounting for baseline heterogeneity in parameters between patients. Conclusion: There is currently insufficient information on how physiological parameters vary prior to exacerbation to support routine domiciliary monitoring for the prediction of exacerbations in COPD. However, the method remains promising.},

  abstract = {Background: The symptom of dyspnea is commonly encountered in patients with underlying serious illness and can lead to distress and poor quality of life. In patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), the prevalence is reported in up to 95\% of patients. With the growth in sensor technologies, continuous monitoring of respiratory metrics provides an opportunity to better understand the relationship between patient-reported dyspnea and objective respiratory measures. Aims: To assess the feasibility of implementing a radio-frequency (RF) sensor in patients with COPD and describe the relationship between dyspnea and respiratory metrics in patients with COPD when compared to healthy controls. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to collect data on dyspnea scores and respiratory metrics in patients with COPD and healthy controls while conducting a walking test using a wearable RF sensor. Results: Of the 12 COPD patients and 15 healthy controls recruited, all participants completed the modified incremental shuttle walking test while wearing the RF sensor; there was no attrition. For every one-point increase in the dyspnea score, there was a mean 1.94 increase in the respiratory rate per minute in the COPD group as compared to a 1.09 increase in respiratory rate in the healthy control group. Conclusion: Preliminary data demonstrate the potential of using the RF sensors to track respiratory metrics in COPD patients and healthy adults. As this technology develops, it shows considerable promise and could provide significant implications regarding the use of non-invasive continuous monitoring for patients with lung disease.},

  abstract = {The demand for wearable devices to measure respiratory activity is constantly growing, finding applications in a wide range of scenarios (e.g., clinical environments and workplaces, outdoors for monitoring sports activities, etc.). Particularly, the respiration rate (RR) is a vital parameter since it indicates serious illness (e.g., pneumonia, emphysema, pulmonary embolism, etc.). Therefore, several solutions have been presented in the scientific literature and on the market to make RR monitoring simple, accurate, reliable and noninvasive. Among the different transduction methods, the piezoresistive and inertial ones satisfactorily meet the requirements for smart wearable devices since unobtrusive, lightweight and easy to integrate. Hence, this review paper focuses on innovative wearable devices, detection strategies and algorithms that exploit piezoresistive or inertial sensors to monitor the breathing parameters. At first, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of innovative piezoresistive wearable devices for measuring user's respiratory variables. Later, a survey of novel piezoresistive textiles to develop wearable devices for detecting breathing movements is reported. Afterwards, the state-of-art about wearable devices to monitor the respiratory parameters, based on inertial sensors (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), is presented for detecting dysfunctions or pathologies in a non-invasive and accurate way. In this field, several processing tools are employed to extract the respiratory parameters from inertial data; therefore, an overview of algorithms and methods to determine the respiratory rate from acceleration data is provided. Finally, comparative analysis for all the covered topics are reported, providing useful insights to develop the next generation of wearable sensors for monitoring respiratory parameters.},

  abstract = {Background Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the ``Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.},

  abstract = {Objective: Respiratory disturbances during sleep are a prevalent health condition that affects a large adult population. The gold standard to evaluate sleep disorders including apnea is overnight polysomnography, which requires a trained technician for live monitoring and post-processing scoring. Currently, the disorder events can hardly be predicted using the respiratory waveforms preceding the events. The objective of this paper is to develop an autonomous system to detect and predict respiratory events reliably based on real-time covert sensing. Methods: A bed-integrated radio-frequency (RF) sensor by near-field coherent sensing (NCS) was employed to retrieve continuous respiratory waveforms without user's awareness. Overnight recordings were collected from 27 patients in the Weill Cornell Center for Sleep Medicine. We extracted respiratory features to feed into the random-forest machine learning model for disorder detection and prediction. The technician annotation, derived from observation by polysomnography, was used as the ground truth during the supervised learning. Results: Apneic event detection achieved a sensitivity and specificity up to 88.6\% and 89.0\% for k-fold validation, and 83.1\% and 91.6\% for subject-independent validation. Prediction of forthcoming apneic events could be made up to 90 s in advance. Apneic event prediction achieved a sensitivity and specificity up to 81.3\% and 82.1\% for k-fold validation, and 80.5\% and 82.4\% for subject-independent validation. The most important features for event detection and prediction can be assessed in the learning model. Conclusion: A bed-integrated RF sensor can covertly and reliably detect and predict apneic events. Significance: Predictive warning of the sleep disorders in advance can intervene serious apnea, especially for infants, servicemen, and patients with chronic conditions.},

Mild coughs are usually overlooked in the early stage, not only because they are barely noticeable by the person and the people around, but also because the present recording method is not comfortable, private, or reliable for long-term monitoring. In this paper, a wearable radio-frequency (RF) sensor is presented to recognize the mild cough signal directly from the local trachea vibration characteristics, and can isolate interferences from nearby people. The sensor operates at the ultra-high-frequency band, and can couple the RF energy to the upper respiratory track by the near field of the sensing antenna. The retrieved tissue vibration caused by the cough airflow burst can then be analyzed by a convolutional neural network trained on the frequency-time spectra. The sensing antenna design is analyzed for performance improvement. During the human study of 5 participants over 100 minutes of prescribed routines, the overall recognition ratio is above 90\% and the false positive ratio during other routines is below 2.09\%.},

The interior conductivity is reconstructed on a discrete representation of the domain using a finite-element method (FEM) mesh and a parametrization of that domain. The reconstruction requires a sequence of numerically intensive calculations. There is strong interest in reducing the cost of these calculations. An improvement in the compute time for current problems would encourage further exploration of computationally challenging problems such as the incorporation of time series data, wide-spread adoption of three-dimensional simulations and correlation of other modalities such as CT and ultrasound. Multicore processors offer an opportunity to reduce EIT computation times but may require some restructuring of the underlying algorithms to maximize the use of available resources. This work profiles two EIT software packages (EIDORS and NDRM) to experimentally determine where the computational costs arise in EIT as problems scale. Sparse matrix solvers, a key component for the FEM forward problem and sensitivity estimates in the inverse problem, are shown to take a considerable portion of the total compute time in these packages. A sparse matrix solver performance measurement tool, Meagre-Crowd, is developed to interface with a variety of solvers and compare their performance over a range of two- and three-dimensional problems of increasing node density. Results show that distributed sparse matrix solvers that operate on multiple cores are advantageous up to a limit that increases as the node density increases. We recommend a selection procedure to find a solver and hardware arrangement matched to the problem and provide guidance and tools to perform that selection.},

Such investigations are often analysed inappropriately, notably by using correlation coefficients. The use of correlation is misleading. An alternative approach, based on graphical techniques and simple calculations, is described, together with the relation between this analysis and the assessment of repeatability.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a 60-GHz CMOS direct-conversion Doppler radar RF sensor with a clutter canceller for single-antenna noncontact human vital-signs detection. A high isolation quasi-circulator (QC) is designed to reduce the transmitting (Tx) power leakage (to the receiver). The clutter canceller performs cancellation for the Tx leakage power (from the QC) and the stationary background reflection clutter to enhance the detection sensitivity of weak vital signals. The integration of the 60-GHz RF sensor consists of the voltage-controlled oscillator, divided-by-2 frequency divider, power amplifier, QC, clutter canceller (consisting of variable-gain amplifier and 360$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ}}$ phase shifter), low-noise amplifier, in-phase/quadrature-phase sub-harmonic mixer, and three couplers. In the human vital-signs detection experimental measurement, at a distance of 75 cm, the detected heartbeat (1–1.3 Hz) and respiratory (0.35–0.45 Hz) signals can be clearly observed with a 60-GHz 17-dBi patch-array antenna. The RF sensor is fabricated in 90-nm CMOS technology with a chip size of {\textbackslash}hbox2 mm{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}hbox2 mm and a consuming power of 217 mW.},

  abstract = {Phase measurements by the quadrature scheme in radio transceivers can be applied to phase-sensitive applications like precision multi-static 3D localization. However, measurements at different channels with individual local oscillators suffer from random phase offsets due to non-repeatable initial phases of phase-locked loops in frequency synthesizers. In this paper, a novel phase calibration method is proposed to cancel out both the random and systematic time-invariant phase offsets at the superheterodyne receiver frontends. Direct phase offset measurements and on-site calibration are made possible by additional hardware connections, achieving simple implementation and accurate differential phase measurements without relying on bandwidth resources. The proposed calibration method generates repeatable phases for each device reboot with standard deviation less than 2 degrees, which translates to 0.9 mm ranging accuracy for 1.8 GHz carrier frequency. This method can also be flexibly extended to accommodate a broad range of practical network scenarios with more channels, various network topologies, and a wider bandwidth.},

  abstract = {The near-field coherent sensing (NCS) system can detect weak cyclic motion inside living bodies, such as human wrist pulses and the heartbeat of small animals. To couple significant energy to the motion source, a GHz RF carrier was employed, where the vibration amplitude was often much smaller than the wavelength. To optimize the signal quality, we presented a small-signal model with nonlinearity analysis by Jacobi--Anger expansion. The quiescent-point determination and signal composition were then discussed to guide the hardware and algorithm design. The model was validated by electromagnetic simulation in CST Studio and a simple robotic platform. A novel algorithm of adaptive control by signal injection was applied to boost both the signal magnitude and data converter utilization. The signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is improved by 35 dB and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 10 dB. Sensing of vocal cord vibration was demonstrated as a potential application, where a harmonic radio frequency identification (RFID) system was chosen for its low noise floor to achieve high-fidelity recording of music scales and procedure words.},
